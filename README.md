 A simple Python script to record everyday productivity and wellness to a csv file

# How to install
 The script can be run by using the windows task scheduler. I found this to be a easy way to run scripts and change the trigger actions that is baked into windows.

 Make sure that when scheduling the conditions for trigger works for your use case.

 i.e. for laptops the setting of stop if not connected to AC should be disabled.
